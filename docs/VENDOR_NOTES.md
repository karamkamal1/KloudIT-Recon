## 2.1 Pluggable quic-go congestion control

Transport-only change: no encoder or GPU code is involved, so AMD and NVIDIA hosts behave the
same. What needs real hardware is the network behaviour on real paths.

Verified in the sandbox (Linux, no GPU, loopback only):

- `third_party/quic-go` is quic-go v0.63.0 + `third_party/quic-go.patch`
  (`third_party/update-quic-go.sh --check`). Upstream tests of the patched packages pass:
  `cd third_party/quic-go && go test ./internal/ackhandler/... ./internal/congestion/... ./congestion/...`
  (including a new factory test). `go test .` there also passes except 5 IPv6 tests, which fail
  the same way on pristine v0.63.0 because the sandbox has no IPv6.
- The rebase script on a scratch copy: `update-quic-go.sh v0.62.0` re-applied the patch with a
  3-way merge (build and tests pass); `update-quic-go.sh v0.48.0` stopped with the list of
  conflicting files and left the tree unchanged.
- `internal/transport/cc` unit tests: window = 1.2 × target × (min RTT + 2 frame intervals)
  within [32, 10000] packets, pacing rate and bursts, no window change on single losses or ECN
  marks, persistent congestion (RFC 9002 7.6.2: lost packets whose send times span more than
  3 × PTO, no ACK in between) collapses to 2 packets and grows back by the acknowledged bytes;
  no collapse for a short outage that is detected more than 3 × PTO after the last ACK (lost
  packets sent within 2 × PTO), for losses on both sides of an ACK, before the first RTT sample
  or after an idle period; RTO collapse.
- Outage check over the real stack (scratch test, not committed: bulk sender at a 20 Mbit/s
  target through a UDP proxy with 20 ms each way, both directions blacked out 1.5 s in;
  3 × PTO ≈ 215 ms): 100/150/200 ms outages 0 collapses, 300 ms 1, 600 ms 2. The first version
  measured from the last ACK to the loss detection and collapsed from 150 ms on.
- Real quic-go client/server over localhost (`internal/transport`): the factory is called once
  per connection, `(*quic.Conn).CongestionControl()` and `transport.MediaControl` return that
  controller on raw QUIC and on WebTransport (via the http3 `ConnContext` hook), 8 MiB flow at
  the configured 480 Mbit/s pacing rate; the reno client has no pluggable controller.
- Throughput under loss (`TestMediaThroughputUnderLoss`: UDP proxy with 20 ms each way = 40 ms
  RTT and 1 % random loss each way, 4 s bulk transfer, target 20 Mbit/s): reno 5.1 Mbit/s,
  media 23.4 Mbit/s (pacing 24 Mbit/s), no collapse. The test asserts only media ≥ 10 Mbit/s.
- `internal/e2e TestStreamingMediaCongestion`: host config `"congestion": "media"`, relay and
  direct sessions stream (frames, key frame, audio), and the captured host log has the
  `media congestion control` record (e.g. `target_kbps=3200 video_kbps=3000 fps=60`) for both
  paths; `TestStreamingPaths` (default reno) requires that no session logs it. A 600 kbit/s
  direct session streams 6 s without the queue-overflow back-off; when the target was the
  video bitrate alone, audio and packet overhead pushed the session past the pacer and it
  "lowered" the bitrate to 2000 kbit/s after about 3 s. Scratch runs at 500 and 1000 kbit/s
  for 14 s: no back-off.
- `internal/host TestMediaTargetSurvivesMigration`: the client migrates (`AddPath`, `Probe`,
  `Switch`), quic-go gives the server a new controller at the 20 Mbit/s default, and the next
  frame restores the session target (without the per-frame re-apply it stayed at 20 Mbit/s).
- `go mod download` with only `go.mod`, `go.sum` and `third_party/quic-go/go.{mod,sum}` present
  (the Docker build's first stage) succeeds; it fails without the vendored `go.mod`, hence the
  extra `COPY` in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`. The image itself was not built.

Not verified (needs real networks):

- Real Wi-Fi/WAN behaviour must be measured with the Phase 0.4 netem profiles, not inferred from
  the loopback proxy above. Test: apply each profile to the link the host's media connection
  crosses. Direct sessions: the client ↔ host path (clumsy on the Windows host, or netem on a
  Linux router between them). Relay sessions: the host → gateway link (clumsy on the host for
  the gateway's UDP port, or netem on an ifb device for the gateway's ingress). On the relay path
  only the host → gateway data connection uses the setting; the gateway → browser WebTransport
  leg stays reno until step 2.6 makes the relay one end-to-end connection, so shaping the
  gateway's interface toward the client would compare reno with reno. Profiles: lan (none), wifi
  `tc qdisc replace dev <if> root netem delay 5ms 10ms loss 1%`, wan
  `tc qdisc replace dev <if> root netem delay 40ms loss 0.5%`, capdrop
  `tc qdisc replace dev <if> root tbf rate 50mbit burst 64kb latency 50ms` then 15mbit then
  50mbit. For each profile stream 2 minutes with `"congestion": "reno"` and with `"media"` in
  `host.json` (restart the agent after editing) and record the overlay's one-way delay p50/p95,
  fps, freezes, the bitrate and the host's `stream stats` log lines.
- Until step 2.2 adds the application rate controller, media paces at 1.2 × the session's
  bitrate (encoder + audio + 200 kbit/s) and never backs off on loss by itself; under a real
  capacity drop (capdrop) only the existing queue-overflow back-off reacts. That is why reno
  stays the default.
- Latency cost of pacing: at 1.2 × the bitrate an average frame is spread over about 83 % of a
  frame interval minus the 10-packet burst (20 Mbit/s at 60 fps: 41.7 kB per frame, about 10 ms
  after the first 12 kB), while reno on a LAN sends a frame at line rate. Test: Phase 0.1
  capture→drawn p50/p95 on lan with reno vs media before 2.2 switches the default; 2.2 may need
  a burst allowance at frame starts or a higher pacing gain.
- AMD RDNA3 (RX 7900 XT): unverified. Test: on the Windows AMD host set `"congestion": "media"`,
  restart the agent, check host.log for `direct WebTransport endpoint listening ... congestion=media`,
  then run the four netem profiles above for direct sessions and, on the host → gateway link
  as described above, for relay sessions, and compare with reno.
- NVIDIA: unverified (no NVIDIA host available). Test: same as AMD on an RTX host.
