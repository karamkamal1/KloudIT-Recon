# Vendor notes

## 0.4 Network impairment harness

`deploy/netem/netem.sh` (also `make netem` / `netem-clear` / `netem-status`) applies the four
profiles to both directions of a Linux interface. On Windows, the equivalent clumsy settings are
in [NETEM.md](NETEM.md#windows-clumsy). The profiles apply to each direction:

| Profile | Each direction |
|---|---|
| `lan` | no impairment |
| `wifi` | 0–15 ms per burst (5 ms ± 10 ms), in order; 1 % loss in bursts of 2 |
| `wan` | 20 ms (40 ms RTT); 0.5 % loss |
| `capdrop` | 50 → 15 → 50 Mbit/s, 20 s steps; queue ≤ 50 ms |

### How every later step reports the four profiles

Relay path: the gateway is container 210 on the Proxmox node and the browser client is
`CLIENT_IP`. First force the relay path in the browser: set Stream settings > Pipeline >
Network path to "Relay via gateway", then Reconnect (or set `directPort` to 0 in the PC's
`host.json`). The default, "Auto", connects straight to the PC on UDP 47998 whenever it can, which
is the usual case on a LAN. The video then never crosses the gateway's veth, and every profile
looks unimpaired. Before measuring, check that the stats overlay's Transport row ends in
`· relay`. Then run as root on the node, from the gateway release folder:

```bash
./netem.sh clear --ct 210                                 # lan
./netem.sh apply wifi --ct 210 --host CLIENT_IP           # wifi
./netem.sh apply wan --ct 210 --host CLIENT_IP            # wan
./netem.sh apply capdrop --ct 210 --host CLIENT_IP        # capdrop: start recording right away;
                                                          # the run covers 0-60 s
./netem.sh status --ct 210                                # paste the first line into the result
```

`--host CLIENT_IP` impairs only the gateway ↔ browser leg. Without it the video crosses the
impaired veth twice, once on each relay leg. For the direct path (UDP 47998), set Network path to
"Direct to PC only" and check that the Transport row ends in `· direct`. The Proxmox node is not in
this path. Run `./netem.sh apply <profile> --iface <nic> --port 47998` on a Linux client, or use
the clumsy settings from NETEM.md on the PC or a Windows client.

Report each metric as `lan / wifi / wan / capdrop` per vendor. Give the netem.sh status line for
each profile, and for `capdrop` the step log that `status` prints, so the 15 Mbit/s window can be
found in the recording. NVIDIA results stay "unverified" until an NVIDIA host is available.

### Hardware and environment checks

- AMD RDNA3 (RX 7900 XT): unverified. Test: stream the relay path with the client on wired LAN
  (Network path "Relay via gateway"; the overlay's Transport row must end in `· relay`). Run each
  of `clear`, `apply wifi`, `apply wan` and `apply capdrop` with `--ct <gateway CTID> --host
  <client IP>` on the Proxmox node. Record the overlay's capture→drawn p50/p95, freezes over
  100 ms and decoder recoveries for 10 minutes per profile (capdrop: for the 60 s run, plus the
  time until the bitrate is back). Expect `status` to show the profile and the client's packets in
  the netem counters (`tc -s qdisc show dev nm-veth<CTID>i0`).
- NVIDIA: unverified (no NVIDIA host available). Test: force the relay path as for AMD (Transport
  row `· relay`), run the same four profiles and record the same metrics.
- Proxmox VE node: unverified (no Proxmox in the sandbox). Test: on the node, run
  `./netem.sh apply wifi --ct 210 --host <client IP>`. Check that `ip -br link` shows
  `nm-veth210i0` and that `pct exec 210 -- ethtool -k eth0` shows the segmentation offloads off.
  From the client, `ping <gateway IP>` should show an RTT of about 0–30 ms with about 2 % loss
  (`wan`: +40 ms). Run `./netem.sh clear --ct 210` and check that the offloads are on again and the
  ifb is gone. Also check what tc does inside the unprivileged container
  (`pct exec 210 -- tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 10ms`). The kernel allows it in a user
  namespace (verified below); Proxmox's AppArmor profile and module loading are not verified.
- Windows clumsy profiles: unverified (no Windows in the sandbox). Test: on the PC, run clumsy 0.3
  as administrator with filter `icmp or (udp and (udp.SrcPort == 47998 or udp.DstPort == 47998))`
  and the settings from NETEM.md. From the client, ping the PC 1000 times at 10/s. For `wifi`,
  tune Throttle *Chance* until the RTT spread is about 0–30 ms; for `wan`, expect RTT +40 ms and
  about 1 % loss. clumsy only touches packets that match its filter, so for `capdrop` add iperf3's
  port: `... or tcp.SrcPort == 5201 or tcp.DstPort == 5201 or udp.SrcPort == 5201 or
  udp.DstPort == 5201`. Run `iperf3 -s` on the PC and `iperf3 -c <PC IP> -u -b 80M -t 60` on the
  client (add `-R` for PC → client), and check that the receiver's rate follows the Bandwidth
  value, close to 50 and 15 Mbit/s. clumsy drops the excess instead of queueing it, so a TCP flow
  will likely stay well below 47 and 14 Mbit/s even when the setting works.

### Verified in the sandbox

Everything ran for real; [NETEM.md](NETEM.md#verification) has the full tables. The test topology
mirrors a Proxmox node: a bridge in its own network namespace, the "container" namespace's `eth0`
as the peer of `veth210i0`, a client namespace, and stub `pct` / `lxc-info` so that `--ct 210`
works. The sandbox kernel has no `sch_netem` and no module support. The netem profiles therefore
ran in a QEMU VM (software emulation) with the Ubuntu 24.04 kernel 6.8, which the Proxmox kernel
is based on, and iproute2 6.1. The VM adds delay noise that varies from run to run: about
0.5–2 ms at the median, but up to about 20 ms at p95 in some runs.

- `bash -n` and `shellcheck` (only the intended `A && B || C` notes) pass.
- `lan`: ping RTT p50 0.64 ms, 0 % loss.
- `wifi`: ping RTT p50/mean/p95 16.4/16.9/29.0 ms, 1.85 % ping loss. One-way delay at 500
  packets/s: p50/mean/p95 7.6/8.4/15.4 ms. netem loss counter 1.04 %, mean loss burst 1.7–1.9
  packets. Reordering: 7 and 0 of 10 000 at 500 packets/s, and 0.2 % at 30 Mbit/s. A little
  reordering also appeared with the fixed `wan` delay.
- `wan`: ping RTT p50 41.6 ms, 0.60 % ping loss. One-way delay p50 21.3 ms. netem loss counter
  0.46 %, single-packet losses.
- `capdrop`, on the sandbox kernel with iperf3 TCP: 47.9/14.4/47.6 Mbit/s (container → client)
  and 47.7/14.2/47.7 Mbit/s (client → container). Step changes at +20.03–20.04 s and
  +40.03–40.04 s. Ping RTT stayed ≤ 62 ms with the queue full (50 ms cap).
- `wifi` jitter model: compared in the VM against the literal `delay 5ms 10ms 25%`, which
  reordered 2838 of 5000 packets of a 500/s stream, and against the same with `rate`, which kept
  the order but put the stream's median at 12.9 ms. `slot 0ms 15ms` kept the order (0 reordered)
  with a median of 7.2 ms. The reorder counts carry the comparison. The delay percentiles of that
  run are mostly VM noise: the unimpaired baseline in the same run had p50 2.0 ms and p95 18.4 ms.
- The host/port/proto filters, IPv6 host filters, `--ct` offload handling (500 GSO batches of 10
  at 10 % loss: 50 skbs dropped with the offloads on, 506 single packets with them off), rollback
  of a failed apply, idempotent apply/clear, refusal of foreign qdiscs with `--force` to override,
  long interface names, and the make targets.
- Root in a child user namespace, which is how the kernel sees an unprivileged container's root,
  could add a qdisc to its own interface and create an ifb with an ingress redirect. The guide's
  "an unprivileged LXC cannot run tc" therefore holds at most because of Proxmox's confinement and
  module loading, not the kernel. The docs recommend the node for the reasons given in NETEM.md.
