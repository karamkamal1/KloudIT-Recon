# Vendor notes

What has been verified where, per GPU vendor, for every step of the dual-vendor upgrade. The
build sandbox has no GPU and no Windows machine: there, changes are verified with Go unit and
integration tests, the browser end-to-end test (headless Chromium against a real gateway and host
agent that encodes a test pattern with the software encoders libx264/libsvtav1), and the Windows
binaries and FFmpeg 8.1 Windows build running under Wine. Everything that needs real hardware is
listed as a check with the exact steps and what to look for. The primary test host is Windows 11
with a Radeon RX 7900 XT (RDNA3); there is no NVIDIA host yet.

Status legend:

- **verified (sandbox)**: confirmed in the build sandbox, by the test named in the line.
- **verified**: confirmed on the named hardware; the line gives date, driver and result.
- **unverified**: not yet run on that hardware; the line gives the test to run.
- **failed**: run on the named hardware and did not pass; the line says what happened.

## 0.1 Per-stage timestamps

Verified in the sandbox:

- verified (sandbox): frame header extension round trip, unknown-tag skipping and rejection of
  malformed blocks (`internal/proto` `TestFrameExt`); `web/static/js/protocol.js` parses the same
  test vectors identically (`TestFrameExtJS`, runs the browser module under node).
- verified (sandbox): v1 clients get the plain 24-byte header with `send_us` = encoder-out time
  (its meaning before the extension, which their congestion detection, frame acks and latency
  readout use) and no `frame-ext` feature in the welcome; v2 clients get `frame-ext`, the
  transport hand-off time in `send_us` and the extension on every frame with
  capture ≤ encodeDone ≤ send, over direct WebTransport, relayed WebTransport and the WebSocket
  relay, which forwards it unchanged (`internal/host` `TestVideoHeader`, `internal/e2e`
  `TestStreamingPaths`).
- verified (sandbox): FFmpeg capture clock (`settb=AVTB,setpts=time(0)*1000000` after the source,
  `-enc_time_base 1:1000000`; first built on setpts' `RTCTIME`, which FFmpeg documents as
  deprecated in favour of `time(0)`; both read `av_gettime()` and gave the same µs wall-clock pts
  on FFmpeg 6.1.1 and 8.1.3 with `showinfo`) at 960×540, 60 fps, 4 Mbit/s: frame rate and bitrate
  are unchanged with vs without it. FFmpeg 6.1.1 (Linux): libx264 61.1 / 61.2 fps,
  3.07 / 3.05 Mbit/s; libsvtav1 60.6 / 60.7 fps, 4.04 / 4.04 Mbit/s; capture→encoded p50 3.9 ms /
  p95 5.6 ms (x264), 34 ms / 41 ms (SVT-AV1 preset 12) (`internal/host/media`
  `TestCaptureClock`). FFmpeg 8.1.3 (BtbN win64 GPL build, the one the installer downloads) under
  Wine: libx264 60.3 / 60.2 fps, 3.17 / 3.16 Mbit/s, capture→encoded p50 4.8 ms; with `RTCTIME`
  ffprobe reported 60/1 fps and a 1/1000000 time base, and SVT-AV1 logged fps 60/1 in both runs.
- verified (sandbox): the probe runs the exact filter and encoder time base once
  (`testCaptureClock`); an expression the build cannot evaluate is rejected, so such a build
  streams without capture stamps instead of failing to start the encoder (`TestCaptureClock`, on
  FFmpeg 6.1.1 and on 8.1.3 under Wine).
- verified (sandbox): Windows clock code (QueryPerformanceCounter host clock,
  GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime for FFmpeg's wall clock) under Wine with the FFmpeg 8.1 build:
  1 µs clock steps, stable wall-clock offset, libx264 capture→encoded p50 4.7 ms, unchanged
  fps/bitrate (`TestClock`, `TestCaptureClock/libx264` in the cross-compiled `media.test.exe`).
- verified (sandbox): the wall-clock to host-clock offset is re-measured every second, not once
  per encoder generation (QPC is not disciplined while W32Time slews and steps the wall clock, and
  a generation can last a whole session). `TestCaptureClockFollowsWallClock` steps the host clock
  500 ms mid-generation: 1.5 s later capture→encoded p50 is 1.3 ms (Linux) / 2.2 ms (FFmpeg 8.1
  under Wine); with the offset measured once per generation it stays at 501 ms. Real slew and
  step behaviour of W32Time is not reproducible here (see the long-run hardware check).
- verified (sandbox): browser E2E (`test/e2e/browser.mjs`, software AV1 decode on a shared
  4-core machine, so the absolute numbers are CPU-bound): on every path all eight stages are
  reported with non-negative p50/p95/p99, end-to-end is labelled capture→draw, and the host log
  has the client's stage summary with `encoder=libsvtav1 vendor=software`.
  The E2E also checks that the mean per-frame sum of the stages equals the mean end-to-end
  recomputed from the raw timestamps. That holds by construction: each stage is the difference of
  neighbouring marks of the same frame, so the sum telescopes to end-to-end. It only shows that
  the client's bookkeeping is consistent (no stage dropped, counted twice or taken from the wrong
  marks); a wrong clock offset, wrong host stamps or a misplaced client mark pass it unchanged.
  Cross-check with a reference outside the client's clock sync and arithmetic: the client's
  capture→encoded and host-queue p50 equal the host's own measurement of the frames the client
  acknowledged in the same 10 s (host log `host_capture`, `host_queue`; 55 vs 55 ms and 0.1 vs
  0.1 ms in the last run, the check allows max(2 ms, 10 %)). That shows the stamps reach the
  client intact and its percentiles are right; it does not validate the host stamps or the clock
  sync. The independent check of the stage numbers is the 0.2 frame barcode (capture→drawn
  measured from the picture) and the 0.3 click-to-photon rig. Example (direct WebTransport,
  p50/p95/p99 ms):
  capture→draw 118/150/166, capture→encoded 50/63/77, host queue 0.1/0.7/3.5, network 11/31/44,
  transfer 1.7/16/32, reorder/wait 0.05/0.4/3.6, decode 41/75/88, draw 5.6/19/24,
  display (est.) 15/45/50.
- Not hardware-specific, found while testing: the FFmpeg 8.1 build's SVT-AV1 rejects the
  software AV1 arguments used on the host (`pred-struct=1` with VBR: "VBR Rate control is
  currently not supported for LOW_DELAY, use CBR mode"). The FFmpeg 6.1 build on Linux accepts
  them. This only affects the software AV1 fallback on Windows.

Hardware checks:

- AMD RDNA3 (RX 7900 XT): unverified. Test: in `host.json` set `"capture": "ddagrab"` and, in
  turn, `"encoder": "hevc_amf"`, `"av1_amf"` and `"h264_amf"` (restart the agent after each
  change). Stream from Chrome on a wired LAN client at 2560×1440 (AV1 on RDNA3 needs 64×16-aligned
  sizes, see A7) and 60 fps with a moving game or video for at least 60 s, overlay open
  (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S). Record per encoder the `latency stages` lines from the host log
  (`encoder=… vendor=amd`, p50/p95/p99 per stage) and the overlay table. Look for: the overlay says
  "End-to-end (capture→draw)", not "Stream latency (send→draw)", and the host log has no
  "implausible capture timestamp" warning (the AMF encoders keep the µs pts); capture→encoded p50
  is about 1–3 frame intervals (expected about one interval more than necessary until 1.1 sets
  `async_depth=1`); the `stream stats` lines show the same fps and Mbit/s as a 60 s run with
  `"captureTimestamps": "off"`; capture→encoded values are not quantized to 1 ms or 15.6 ms steps
  (in the browser console post `{type:'stageDump'}` to `__recon.worker`, then inspect
  `__recon.stageDump[i].stages[0]`), which would mean the FFmpeg build's `av_gettime()` uses the
  coarse system time. Long run: stream one session for 30+ minutes without changing settings (one
  encoder generation: no new `encoder ready` line in the host log) and check that the host log
  has no "implausible capture timestamp" warning and that capture→encoded p50 does not drift
  steadily from the first to the last `latency stages` line (same scene: within 1 ms; W32Time
  drift and steps between the wall clock and QPC are followed by the per-second offset
  re-measurement); also that `capture` and `host_capture` agree in every `latency stages` line.
- NVIDIA: unverified (no NVIDIA host available). Test: the same as for AMD with `"capture":
  "ddagrab"` and `"encoder"` set in turn to `hevc_nvenc`, `av1_nvenc` (RTX 40 and newer) and
  `h264_nvenc`, at 1920×1080 and 2560×1440, 60 fps; record the `latency stages` lines per encoder
  and check the same four points (capture→draw label and no implausible-timestamp warning,
  capture→encoded about one frame interval or less, fps/bitrate equal to a
  `"captureTimestamps": "off"` run, no quantized values) plus the 30+ minute single-generation run
  (no "implausible capture timestamp" warning, no steady drift of capture→encoded p50).
