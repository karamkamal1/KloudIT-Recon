# Vendor notes

What has been verified where, per GPU vendor, for every step of the dual-vendor upgrade. The
build sandbox has no GPU and no Windows machine: there, changes are verified with Go unit and
integration tests, the browser end-to-end test (headless Chromium against a real gateway and host
agent that encodes a test pattern with the software encoders libx264/libsvtav1), and the Windows
binaries and FFmpeg 8.1 Windows build running under Wine. Everything that needs real hardware is
listed as a check with the exact steps and what to look for. The primary test host is Windows 11
with a Radeon RX 7900 XT (RDNA3); there is no NVIDIA host yet.

Status legend:

- **verified (sandbox)**: confirmed in the build sandbox, by the test named in the line.
- **verified**: confirmed on the named hardware; the line gives date, driver and result.
- **unverified**: not yet run on that hardware; the line gives the test to run.
- **failed**: run on the named hardware and did not pass; the line says what happened.

## 0.1 Per-stage timestamps

Verified in the sandbox:

- verified (sandbox): frame header extension round trip, unknown-tag skipping and rejection of
  malformed blocks (`internal/proto` `TestFrameExt`); `web/static/js/protocol.js` parses the same
  test vectors identically (`TestFrameExtJS`, runs the browser module under node).
- verified (sandbox): v1 clients get the plain 24-byte header with `send_us` = encoder-out time
  (its meaning before the extension, which their congestion detection, frame acks and latency
  readout use) and no `frame-ext` feature in the welcome; v2 clients get `frame-ext`, the
  transport hand-off time in `send_us` and the extension on every frame with
  capture ≤ encodeDone ≤ send, over direct WebTransport, relayed WebTransport and the WebSocket
  relay, which forwards it unchanged (`internal/host` `TestVideoHeader`, `internal/e2e`
  `TestStreamingPaths`).
- verified (sandbox): FFmpeg capture clock (`settb=AVTB,setpts=time(0)*1000000` after the source,
  `-enc_time_base 1:1000000`; first built on setpts' `RTCTIME`, which FFmpeg documents as
  deprecated in favour of `time(0)`; both read `av_gettime()` and gave the same µs wall-clock pts
  on FFmpeg 6.1.1 and 8.1.3 with `showinfo`) at 960×540, 60 fps, 4 Mbit/s: frame rate and bitrate
  are unchanged with vs without it. FFmpeg 6.1.1 (Linux): libx264 61.1 / 61.2 fps,
  3.07 / 3.05 Mbit/s; libsvtav1 60.6 / 60.7 fps, 4.04 / 4.04 Mbit/s; capture→encoded p50 3.9 ms /
  p95 5.6 ms (x264), 34 ms / 41 ms (SVT-AV1 preset 12) (`internal/host/media`
  `TestCaptureClock`). FFmpeg 8.1.3 (BtbN win64 GPL build, the one the installer downloads) under
  Wine: libx264 60.3 / 60.2 fps, 3.17 / 3.16 Mbit/s, capture→encoded p50 4.8 ms; with `RTCTIME`
  ffprobe reported 60/1 fps and a 1/1000000 time base, and SVT-AV1 logged fps 60/1 in both runs.
- verified (sandbox): the probe runs the exact filter and encoder time base once
  (`testCaptureClock`); an expression the build cannot evaluate is rejected, so such a build
  streams without capture stamps instead of failing to start the encoder (`TestCaptureClock`, on
  FFmpeg 6.1.1 and on 8.1.3 under Wine).
- verified (sandbox): Windows clock code (QueryPerformanceCounter host clock,
  GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime for FFmpeg's wall clock) under Wine with the FFmpeg 8.1 build:
  1 µs clock steps, stable wall-clock offset, libx264 capture→encoded p50 4.7 ms, unchanged
  fps/bitrate (`TestClock`, `TestCaptureClock/libx264` in the cross-compiled `media.test.exe`).
- verified (sandbox): the wall-clock to host-clock offset is re-measured every second, not once
  per encoder generation (QPC is not disciplined while W32Time slews and steps the wall clock, and
  a generation can last a whole session). `TestCaptureClockFollowsWallClock` steps the host clock
  500 ms mid-generation: 1.5 s later capture→encoded p50 is 1.3 ms (Linux) / 2.2 ms (FFmpeg 8.1
  under Wine); with the offset measured once per generation it stays at 501 ms. Real slew and
  step behaviour of W32Time is not reproducible here (see the long-run hardware check).
- verified (sandbox): browser E2E (`test/e2e/browser.mjs`, software AV1 decode on a shared
  4-core machine, so the absolute numbers are CPU-bound): on every path all eight stages are
  reported with non-negative p50/p95/p99, end-to-end is labelled capture→draw, and the host log
  has the client's stage summary with `encoder=libsvtav1 vendor=software`.
  The E2E also checks that the mean per-frame sum of the stages equals the mean end-to-end
  recomputed from the raw timestamps. That holds by construction: each stage is the difference of
  neighbouring marks of the same frame, so the sum telescopes to end-to-end. It only shows that
  the client's bookkeeping is consistent (no stage dropped, counted twice or taken from the wrong
  marks); a wrong clock offset, wrong host stamps or a misplaced client mark pass it unchanged.
  Cross-check with a reference outside the client's clock sync and arithmetic: the client's
  capture→encoded and host-queue p50 equal the host's own measurement of the frames the client
  acknowledged in the same 10 s (host log `host_capture`, `host_queue`; 55 vs 55 ms and 0.1 vs
  0.1 ms in the last run, the check allows max(2 ms, 10 %)). That shows the stamps reach the
  client intact and its percentiles are right; it does not validate the host stamps or the clock
  sync. The independent check of the stage numbers is the 0.2 frame barcode (capture→drawn
  measured from the picture) and the 0.3 click-to-photon rig. Example (direct WebTransport,
  p50/p95/p99 ms):
  capture→draw 118/150/166, capture→encoded 50/63/77, host queue 0.1/0.7/3.5, network 11/31/44,
  transfer 1.7/16/32, reorder/wait 0.05/0.4/3.6, decode 41/75/88, draw 5.6/19/24,
  display (est.) 15/45/50.
- Not hardware-specific, found while testing: the FFmpeg 8.1 build's SVT-AV1 rejects the
  software AV1 arguments used on the host (`pred-struct=1` with VBR: "VBR Rate control is
  currently not supported for LOW_DELAY, use CBR mode"). The FFmpeg 6.1 build on Linux accepts
  them. This only affects the software AV1 fallback on Windows.

Hardware checks:

- AMD RDNA3 (RX 7900 XT): unverified. Test: in `host.json` set `"capture": "ddagrab"` and, in
  turn, `"encoder": "hevc_amf"`, `"av1_amf"` and `"h264_amf"` (restart the agent after each
  change). Stream from Chrome on a wired LAN client at 2560×1440 (AV1 on RDNA3 needs 64×16-aligned
  sizes, see A7) and 60 fps with a moving game or video for at least 60 s, overlay open
  (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S). Record per encoder the `latency stages` lines from the host log
  (`encoder=… vendor=amd`, p50/p95/p99 per stage) and the overlay table. Look for: the overlay says
  "End-to-end (capture→draw)", not "Stream latency (send→draw)", and the host log has no
  "implausible capture timestamp" warning (the AMF encoders keep the µs pts); capture→encoded p50
  is about 1–3 frame intervals (expected about one interval more than necessary until 1.1 sets
  `async_depth=1`); the `stream stats` lines show the same fps and Mbit/s as a 60 s run with
  `"captureTimestamps": "off"`; capture→encoded values are not quantized to 1 ms or 15.6 ms steps
  (in the browser console post `{type:'stageDump'}` to `__recon.worker`, then inspect
  `__recon.stageDump[i].stages[0]`), which would mean the FFmpeg build's `av_gettime()` uses the
  coarse system time. Long run: stream one session for 30+ minutes without changing settings (one
  encoder generation: no new `encoder ready` line in the host log) and check that the host log
  has no "implausible capture timestamp" warning and that capture→encoded p50 does not drift
  steadily from the first to the last `latency stages` line (same scene: within 1 ms; W32Time
  drift and steps between the wall clock and QPC are followed by the per-second offset
  re-measurement); also that `capture` and `host_capture` agree in every `latency stages` line.
- NVIDIA: unverified (no NVIDIA host available). Test: the same as for AMD with `"capture":
  "ddagrab"` and `"encoder"` set in turn to `hevc_nvenc`, `av1_nvenc` (RTX 40 and newer) and
  `h264_nvenc`, at 1920×1080 and 2560×1440, 60 fps; record the `latency stages` lines per encoder
  and check the same four points (capture→draw label and no implausible-timestamp warning,
  capture→encoded about one frame interval or less, fps/bitrate equal to a
  `"captureTimestamps": "off"` run, no quantized values) plus the 30+ minute single-generation run
  (no "implausible capture timestamp" warning, no steady drift of capture→encoded p50).

## 0.2 In-band frame counter

A frame barcode (16-bit value + CRC-8, 8×3 black/white cells in the top-left corner; format in
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, "Frame barcode") read back by the client from 1 in 30 decoded frames.
Sources: the test pattern (`"capture": "test"`) draws each frame's `seq` with FFmpeg `drawbox`
filters (client mode `seq`); `tools/latency-test/index.html`, opened full-screen on the host,
draws the host's wall-clock milliseconds every animation frame (client mode `wallclock`, enabled
with Settings → Diagnostics → Latency probe). The overlay shows the counts and the capture→drawn
(seq) or host screen→drawn (wallclock) histogram; **Export latency data** saves it as JSON.

### Running the 10-minute latency test (tools/latency-test)

1. On the host PC, open `latency-test\index.html` from the release zip (repository:
   `tools/latency-test/index.html`) in Chrome or Edge **on the streamed monitor** and make it
   full-screen (click the page or press F; or start it with
   `chrome.exe --kiosk "file:///C:/path/to/latency-test/index.html"`). The page shows its fps, the
   cell size (1/96 of the screen width) and the current barcode value, and warns if it is not
   full-screen. Nothing may cover the top-left corner (no overlays such as the Xbox Game Bar or
   the GPU driver's performance overlay there); the mouse pointer is hidden over the page.
2. Stream the whole monitor at its native resolution or the same aspect ratio (the barcode must
   stay at the picture's top-left corner; the cell size scales with the picture width).
3. In the browser client: Settings (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O) → Diagnostics → **Latency probe (host test
   page)**; open the overlay (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S). After a few seconds the overlay shows
   `Frame barcode (wallclock)` with the sampled count and valid share, `host screen→drawn
   (barcode)` p50/p95/p99 and `page→capture (stamps)`.
4. Keep streaming for 10 minutes without changing settings (no window over the test page, the
   client tab visible), then click **Export latency data** in the overlay. The JSON contains the
   1 ms histogram, every sample (`t_s, gen, seq, barcode, latency_ms, page_to_capture_ms`), the
   stage summary (capture→encoded, queue, network, … for the last 10 s), the encoder and the
   connection. Keep the file with the results below.
5. What to look for: valid ≥ 90 % of samples and 0 implausible (otherwise the page is not at the
   top-left corner, not full-screen, covered, or the clocks are off); page→capture p50 of about
   1–2 refresh intervals (the page's frame time to DDA capture: render, present, capture) and
   never below −2 ms (a negative value means the wall-clock offset or the clock sync is wrong);
   host screen→drawn p50 ≈ page→capture p50 + the overlay's capture→draw p50 (the stage stamps
   and the picture agree); no slow drift of the samples over the 10 minutes (plot
   `latency_ms` over `t_s`). Repeat with Settings → Renderer = WebGPU (export `method`
   = `webgpu`) and with the 2D canvas (`copyTo NV12` or `canvas …`).

Verified in the sandbox:

- verified (sandbox): format: CRC-8/I-432-1 (check value 0xA1), round trip of all 65536 values,
  every 1- and 2-cell error rejected, an all-black or all-white corner rejected, cells that are
  neither clearly dark (< 96) nor light (> 160) rejected, decoding from a box-blurred luma plane
  with 16, 13.3 and 20 px cells (`internal/proto` `TestBarcode`). `web/static/js/protocol.js` and
  the encoder copy in `tools/latency-test/index.html` produce the same 65536 words, sample
  rectangles, thresholds and decode results as Go (`TestBarcodeJS`, runs both under node; a
  mutated CRC in the page or a mutated threshold in protocol.js fails it).
- verified (sandbox): test pattern barcode (FFmpeg `drawbox` chain, one box per cell, timeline
  expressions on the frame index `n`; CRC bits as sums mod 2 of `gt(bitand(n,2^i),0)`). The
  probe draws three frames and reads back 0, 1, 2 before the host announces `barcode-seq`.
  Through the Video manager, every frame decodes (FFmpeg, H.264 Annex B / AV1 in IVF) to a
  barcode equal to its `Frame.Seq`: 180/180 frames at 4000 and at 500 kbit/s, 960×540 60 fps,
  libx264 and libsvtav1 on FFmpeg 6.1.1, libx264 on FFmpeg 8.1.3 (BtbN win64 build) under Wine
  (`internal/host/media` `TestBarcodeFilter`; libsvtav1 on 8.1 fails for the pre-existing reason
  noted in 0.1). Frame rate and bitrate unchanged (FFmpeg 6.1.1: libx264 61.9 / 60.2 fps,
  3.06 / 3.19 Mbit/s; libsvtav1 60.7 / 60.6 fps, 4.03 / 4.03 Mbit/s; 8.1.3 under Wine: libx264
  60.2 / 60.2 fps); capture→encoded p50 4.4 / 4.3 ms under Wine, 3.6 / 4.4 ms and 34 / 37 ms on
  Linux (run-to-run noise on a shared 4-core machine). Filter cost alone (`ffmpeg -benchmark`,
  1200 frames of `testsrc2` in `-filter_complex` with vs without the chain, one filter thread,
  mean of 3 runs): 960×540 0.69 / 0.74 s of CPU (≤ 0.05 ms per frame), 1920×1080 2.72 / 2.88 s
  (inside the run-to-run spread of 2.6–3.2 s).
- verified (sandbox): every welcome on every path (direct and relayed WebTransport, v1 and v2
  clients) lists `barcode-seq` with the test source and carries a plausible `wallOffsetUs`
  (`internal/e2e` `TestStreamingPaths`); v2 clients get `{"t":"clock"}` refreshes every 5 s
  (used by the wallclock run below).
- verified (sandbox): browser E2E, seq mode (`test/e2e/browser.mjs`, headless Chromium, software
  AV1 decode, 2D canvas renderer: `VideoFrame.copyTo` of the corner of I420 frames): 8 runs × 4
  scenarios (direct and relayed WebTransport, WebSocket relay, "WebGPU renderer"), 384 sampled
  frames, 382 with a valid barcode equal to the frame's seq (≥ 91 % in every scenario, 100 % in 30
  of 32), 0 mismatched, 2 invalid; 2–17 samples per scenario and run (fewer when the overloaded
  machine stalled decoding); capture→drawn histogram p50 79–403 ms (software AV1 decode on a CPU
  shared with other jobs). One invalid sample was recorded with its cells: all 24 cells were
  clean black/white and the value rows read the frame's own seq (103), but one CRC cell still
  showed the previous frame's content: a 16×16 block of the picture had not been updated
  (encoded as a skip from the reference at a congestion-reduced bitrate, or concealed by the
  decoder), which is what the CRC is there to catch. The overlay's "Export latency data"
  downloads the JSON with the histogram, the samples and the stage summary. Under that load
  the E2E's steady-playback checks failed in some scenarios with and without this change alike
  (A/B against the 0.1 tree: baseline 4 and 11 failed checks, this change 5 and 1, all of them
  fps dips, decoder-backlog recoveries or checks that follow from them; the last two runs of this
  change failed only fps checks, "steady real-time playback" in both and "video decoding" in the
  first (6 and 2 checks), at a load average of about 6 from other jobs). The E2E's "WebGPU
  renderer" scenario falls back to the 2D canvas here (see next item), so it exercises the same
  readback.
- verified (sandbox): WebGPU readback, partly. Headless Chromium's SwiftShader WebGPU drops its
  instance as soon as `importExternalTexture` is called ("Instance dropped in popErrorScope";
  that is also why the E2E's WebGPU scenario falls back to the 2D canvas), so the external-texture
  path cannot run here. The probe shader and pipeline with `texture_external` compile and
  validate without errors; the same shader body with a regular texture (`textureSampleLevel`
  instead of `textureSampleBaseClampToEdge`), the renderer's own `probePass` / `probeRead`
  (render to 8×3 `rgba8unorm`, `copyTextureToBuffer` with 256-byte rows, `mapAsync`) decoded 5/5
  barcodes: 960×540 with 16 px cells, 1280×720 with 13.3 px, 1920×1080 with 20 px, 3840×2160 with
  40 px (values 4242, 777, 31337, 65535, 0).
- verified (sandbox): browser E2E, wallclock mode, end to end: Xvfb display with
  `tools/latency-test/index.html` full-screen in a second (headed, kiosk) Chromium, the host agent
  restarted on `x11grab` of that display (libsvtav1, 1280×720; 60 fps in three runs, 30 fps in
  the final version of the test), client with the latency probe enabled. Test page itself:
  x11grab frames decoded with `BarcodeReadLuma` 120/120 valid, consecutive values 16–17 ms apart.
  Streamed: 16/16 samples valid in each of the 6 runs that reached the check, 0 implausible; page→capture (barcode wall clock
  converted with `wallOffsetUs` and the clock sync, against the frame's capture stamp) p50
  47–56 ms at 60 fps and 28–49 ms at 30 fps, minimum 24–44 ms (Chromium on Xvfb without vsync:
  render, software compositing and the x11grab timer), never negative; host screen→drawn p50
  164–323 ms (overloaded machine, software AV1).
- verified (sandbox): the 10-minute wallclock run (`E2E_WALLCLOCK_SECONDS=600`, same setup at
  30 fps, WebSocket relay, 2D canvas, `copyTo I420`): 606 s, 606/606 samples valid, 0 implausible,
  0 skipped; the 16-bit millisecond counter wrapped 10 times without a jump in the latency; host
  screen→drawn p50/p95/p99 162/187/240 ms (min 130, max 372), page→capture p50/p95/p99 42/52/61 ms
  (min 10); per-minute p50 155–170 ms with no drift; the stage stamps' capture→draw p50 over the
  last 10 s was 124 ms, consistent with 162 − 42 ms. The 1 ms histogram had 74 buckets; the export
  held all 606 samples.
- Seen in the sandbox, not caused by this step: headless Chromium's renderer crashed (a CHECK,
  `trap int3` in its main or compositor thread, the same crash site every time) in several long
  E2E runs on this machine, with this change and in a control run of the unchanged 0.1 tree (no
  probe code at all), while the machine's root file system was full (100 %, 140–250 MB free, filled
  by other jobs; Playwright's Chromium keeps its shared memory in /tmp). A crashed tab ends the run
  with "Target crashed"; if a 10-minute run on real hardware ends like that, check free disk and
  memory on the client first.
- Not verifiable here: hardware-decoded (GPU-backed) VideoFrames, where `copyTo` may need a
  readback or fall back to `drawImage` (the export's `method` says which ran), and the WebGPU
  external-texture readback; both are hardware checks below.
- Native helper (Phase 3), requirement: to serve the seq mode the helper must draw
  `proto.BarcodeWord(uint16(frameId))` (the 16-bit frame id and its CRC-8/I-432-1) as 24 cells,
  8 per row, most significant bit first, 16×16 px at the top-left corner (white/black at Y
  235/16 reads correctly), and the host may announce `barcode-seq` only when that frame id is the
  frame's `seq`. The barcode layout from Phase 3.2 (native track) is not enough on its own: it
  draws the raw low `bits` of the frame id with no CRC, so with `bits: 24` the client would
  reject every sample as invalid. The helper has to compute the CRC word itself (or take a value
  transform) first.

Hardware checks:

- AMD RDNA3 (RX 7900 XT): unverified. Test (seq, hardware encode and decode): in `host.json` set
  `"capture": "test"`, `"testWidth": 2560, "testHeight": 1440` and in turn `"encoder":
  "hevc_amf"`, `"av1_amf"`, `"h264_amf"`; stream to Chrome on a client with hardware decode, overlay
  open, 2D canvas renderer and then WebGPU (Settings → Renderer, reconnect). Look for: overlay
  `Frame barcode (seq)` valid ≥ 99 % and 0 mismatched after 2 minutes (a mismatch means a frame
  was shown out of order or twice, or AMF skipped a frame: compare with `skip_frame`/
  `frame_skipping` in 1.1), the export's `method` (`copyTo NV12` / `canvas …` / `webgpu`), and the
  capture→drawn p50 within ±2 ms of the overlay's End-to-end (capture→draw) p50. Test (wallclock,
  the 10-minute run): `"capture": "ddagrab"` (and once `gfxcapture`), encoders `hevc_amf`,
  `av1_amf` (2560×1440: RDNA3 AV1 alignment, A7), `h264_amf`, 60 fps, wired LAN client; follow
  "Running the 10-minute latency test" above; record per encoder and renderer: valid share,
  implausible count, host screen→drawn p50/p95/p99, page→capture p50/p95, the overlay's
  capture→draw p50, and attach the exported JSON. Expect page→capture ≈ 1–2 refresh intervals with
  ddagrab (FFmpeg's own timer, B7) and host screen→drawn ≈ page→capture + capture→draw (±2 ms).
- NVIDIA: unverified (no NVIDIA host available). Test: the same two runs with `hevc_nvenc`,
  `av1_nvenc` (RTX 40 and newer) and `h264_nvenc` at 1920×1080 and 2560×1440, 60 fps: seq mode
  valid ≥ 99 %, 0 mismatched, capture→drawn p50 within ±2 ms of capture→draw; the 10-minute
  wallclock run with ddagrab, recording the same numbers and the exported JSON.
## 0.3 Physical click-to-photon rig

Rig, host page and analysis: `tools/latency-rig/`. How to build, calibrate and measure:
[LATENCY_RIG.md](LATENCY_RIG.md). Acceptance: ≥ 200 samples per configuration, median and
p95, and a native Moonlight + Sunshine baseline on the same hardware.

Hardware acceptance (none of it could run in the build sandbox: no GPU, no Windows, no
microcontroller):

- AMD RDNA3 (RX 7900 XT): unverified. Test: build the rig with two sensors (client screen on A0, host monitor on A1) and plug it into a 120 Hz Windows client on wired LAN. Open `tools/latency-rig/flash.html` fullscreen on the host. With identical settings in both (HEVC, 1920×1080, 120 fps, same bitrate, fullscreen; Moonlight V-Sync and frame pacing off), alternate 100-sample blocks of `python3 tools/latency-rig/rig.py measure --port COMx --host-sensor --label moonlight-hevc-1080p120-lan-amd --samples 100` and `... --label recon-hevc-1080p120-lan-chrome-amd ...` (Sunshine stream stopped while Recon runs and vice versa) until each label has ≥ 200 samples. Then run `rig.py analyze results/*.csv --baseline moonlight-hevc-1080p120-lan-amd --strict --json results/summary-amd.json` and paste the table here. Pass: exit code 0 (≥ 200 click→client samples each), timeouts 0 or explained, and Recon's click→client median within ~5–10 ms of Moonlight's (acceptance T2). Repeat for the wifi, wan and capdrop profiles once step 0.4 exists.
- NVIDIA: unverified (no NVIDIA host available). Test: the same procedure on an RTX 20/30/40/50 host (HEVC; also AV1 on RTX 40+), labels ending in `-nvidia`, baseline `moonlight-hevc-1080p120-lan-nvidia`. Same pass criteria.
- Rig firmware on an ATmega32U4 (Leonardo / Pro Micro): unverified (compiled only). Test: flash it, open a serial monitor at 115200 baud and send `i`: it must print `board=atmega32u4 hid=avr`. Send `mon` while covering/uncovering the sensor: the first `# lvl` value follows the light. From a CR+LF terminal (Arduino Serial Monitor *Both NL & CR*, or `python -m serial.tools.miniterm`), `r 5` must take 5 samples and `mon` must keep printing; neither may stop at once with `# stopped`. On the flash page, `cal` prints black/white with no `# err`, and `c` prints `id,click_us,client_us,` with a plausible client_us − click_us. `i` then prints `us per loop` (expect tens of µs with two sensors). The client must enumerate a HID mouse plus a COM port, and USB Device Tree Viewer must show the HID interrupt IN endpoint with bInterval 1 ms.
- Rig firmware on an RP2040 (both USB stacks: Pico SDK and Adafruit TinyUSB): unverified (compiled only). Test: the same checks as for the ATmega32U4 (`board=rp2040 hid=pico-sdk` / `hid=adafruit-tinyusb`). USB Device Tree Viewer must show bInterval 1 ms on the HID endpoint for both stacks. The core default is 10 ms, and this sketch overrides it.
- Sensors (BPW34 + 47 kΩ + 1 nF, TEMT6000 breakout): unverified. Test: `mon` on the flash page at 100 % monitor brightness: black near 0 and white ≥ 20 % of full scale (or saturated). `cal` must print no `noisy` or `flickers` warning. If it does, shield the sensor or check for a PWM backlight.
- Rig vs 240 fps camera cross-check: unverified. Test: during a 50-sample `r 50` run, film the rig's LED and the client screen at 240 fps. Run the FFmpeg signalstats commands from LATENCY_RIG.md on the original file, then `rig.py camera --click led.txt --client client.txt --out cam.csv`, and `rig.py analyze cam.csv <rig capture of the same run> --min-samples 50`. The two click→client medians must agree within one camera frame (4.2 ms). Repeat with the phone's slow-motion export of the same clip and `rig.py camera ... --fps 240`: the median must match the original file's.
- `rig.py` serial on Windows (built-in ctypes path without pyserial, and the pyserial path) and on macOS: unverified. Test: `python rig.py measure --port COM5 --label smoke --samples 5 --min-samples 5` on a Windows client without pyserial, then with `pip install pyserial`, and with `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS. Each run must print the rig info and calibration and record 5 samples. A Leonardo must not reset into its bootloader when the port opens.
- flash.html on the real host (Chrome/Edge on Windows 11): unverified. Test: open it fullscreen. The instructions must show `canvas-desynchronized`, and holding any key or mouse button (locally, through Moonlight and through Recon) must turn the whole host monitor white until release.
- PresentMon on the client browser GPU process: unverified. Test: while streaming fullscreen, run `PresentMon-2.x-x64.exe --process_name chrome.exe --output_file recon-chrome.csv --timed 30 --terminate_after_timed` (and `--process_name Moonlight.exe`), then `rig.py presentmon <csv>`. Record the PresentMode shares per renderer (2D desynchronized, WebGPU) next to the click-to-photon numbers. Expect Independent Flip for Moonlight fullscreen. For Recon, "Composed: Flip" means about one refresh of extra latency (find the cause per LATENCY_RIG.md).

Verified in the sandbox:

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/latency-rig/test` (17 tests, Python 3.13) covers:
  capture parsing (comments, repeated headers, `timeout` and empty fields, `micros()` wrap at
  2^32, light-before-click rejected); percentiles cross-checked against
  `statistics.quantiles(method="inclusive")`; JSON/CSV summaries and baseline deltas; `--strict`
  exit code 2 for a 150-sample configuration; the PresentMon summary; and the Win32
  DCB/COMMTIMEOUTS layouts (28/20 bytes). It also runs `rig.py measure` end to end against a
  fake rig that speaks the firmware protocol over a pseudo-terminal: calibration, host sensor
  on/off/missing, samples of an interrupted button-started run excluded, and the clock
  wrapping mid-run. Finally it runs the camera fallback end to end: a synthetic 240 fps clip
  encoded with FFmpeg, brightness logged with the exact FFmpeg commands from the doc, and edges
  matched to the frame-quantized truth within 2 µs. The clip is longer than 10 s, which exposed
  and now covers FFmpeg's 6-digit `pts_time` (times are rebuilt from `pts`). The same clip
  exported 8× slowed down (`setpts=8*PTS`, 30 fps, like a phone's slow-motion export) gives
  the same numbers with `camera --fps 240` (without it every latency came out 8× too long).
  CI and `make test` run these tests (Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 all pass); CI and `make e2e`
  run `flash_smoke.mjs`.
- `rig.py selftest`: synthetic captures (A/B blocks, timeouts, wrap) give exactly the
  generator's median, p95, min and max.
- `rig.py simulate` and `rig.py measure` run as separate processes collected 210 samples and
  printed the summary.
- `node tools/latency-rig/test/flash_smoke.mjs` (headless Chromium via Playwright 1.56, run
  both with `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` and through the default `test/e2e/node_modules` lookup) passes
  26 checks. It runs both page modes; `getContextAttributes().desynchronized` is true in
  Chromium. Screenshot pixels are black at rest, white while a mouse button or key is held
  (chorded buttons, key auto-repeat), and black after the last release and after a fast click.
  The counters match, there are no page errors and no external resources. The test caught a
  real bug: an author `display:flex` overrode the `hidden` attribute, so the instructions
  overlay never went away. Fixed.
- Firmware compiles with arduino-cli 1.5.2-rc.1 and `--warnings all` (no warnings from the
  sketch) for: `arduino:avr:leonardo` and `arduino:avr:micro` (AVR core 1.8.8 + Mouse 1.0.1:
  16.5 KB flash, 585 B RAM); `rp2040:rp2040:rpipico` with the Pico SDK stack and with
  `usbstack=tinyusb`; and `rp2040:rp2040:rpipico2` (core 6.2.0). ELF checks: the Pico SDK build
  holds `usb_hid_poll_interval = 1` (the core's weak default of 10 ms is overridden), and
  `-DHOST_SENSOR=1` via `compiler.cpp.extra_flags` takes effect.
- Firmware line input with LF, CR and CR+LF endings: the sketch's own `LineReader` and
  `inputPending()`, compiled on the host against a fake `Stream`. All three endings start
  `r 200`, `x` or an empty line still stops it, and a `\n` that arrives in a later USB packet
  than its `\r` is dropped too. This caught a real bug: the reader returned a CR+LF line at
  the `\r` and the queued `\n` stopped the run at once (`# stopped`; likewise `cal` and
  `mon`). Fixed.
