# Vendor notes

## 3.1 Helper skeleton

recon-encoder.exe core (control protocol on stdin/stdout, shared-memory frame ring,
Backend/Capture interfaces, threads), mock backend, stub AMF/NVENC/DDA/AMD Direct
Capture/WGC backends that only probe, and the Go client `internal/host/encoder`.
Protocol and ring layout: docs/HELPER_PROTOCOL.md. Nothing in this step touches a GPU,
so the vendor checks below are about the probing and the process plumbing on real
Windows hosts; capture and encode are 3.2 / 3.3 / 3.4.

Verified in the sandbox (Linux, no GPU, no Windows):
- mingw-w64 (GCC 13, posix threads) cross build, static, no warnings with -Wall -Wextra:
  `make helper` -> dist/windows/recon-encoder.exe. Second compiler: every source passes
  `clang++ --target=x86_64-w64-mingw32 -std=c++20 -fsyntax-only -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic
  -Wshadow -Wconversion` without warnings. The MSVC build is not verified here (CI job
  `helper-windows` builds it with MSVC and runs the same Go tests natively).
- Go integration tests under Wine 9.0 against the mingw build (`make helper-test
  WINE=/usr/lib/wine/wine64`, i.e. `GOOS=windows go test -c` + wine): caps (mock, and
  auto with every real backend reported unavailable with its reason), start / bad start
  / second start, Annex-B frames with SPS+PPS+IDR first and P frames after, contiguous
  frame ids and ordered QPC timestamps, forceIdr and recover (no LTR) give an IDR on the
  next frame, setRate shows up in stats, ring full (frames not read for 1.5 s) drops the
  newest frames with `stats.dropped`/`reason ringFull` and the next delivered frame has
  `DroppedBefore` matching the frame-id gap, non-fatal and fatal injected errors,
  oversized control frame -> fatal `protocol`, bad inherited handles -> fatal `ring` +
  exit 2, kill -> ExitError, clean shutdown with exit 0. Restart after a fatal error to
  the first (IDR) frame of the new helper: 170-240 ms under Wine (several runs).
- The bitstream received by Go before the ring-full check (19 frames including two
  forced mid-GOP IDRs) decodes without a single warning:
  `ffmpeg -v warning -err_detect +crccheck+bitstream+buffer+explode -f h264 -i dump.h264 -f null -`
  (dump written by the integration test with `RECON_HELPER_DUMP`).
- Unit tests on Linux (`go test -race ./internal/host/encoder`): message encoding uses
  the field names the C++ parser expects, ring reader bounds checks (sequence, payload
  offset/size, counters ahead/behind, wrap-around, drop accounting), fuzzing of the slot
  header parser (`go test -fuzz FuzzRingSlot`, 20 s, no failures), client lifecycle
  against an in-process fake helper.
- Under Wine `--backend=auto` finds no DXGI adapter (headless), so `vendor` is `other`
  and `adapterLuid` empty; on Windows it reports DXGI adapter 0.
- Exit watchdog (review fix): with `--mock-hang-at=5` (submit never returns) the helper
  terminates itself with exit code 4 about 510 ms after stdin EOF, and `Close` returns
  after about 610 ms instead of killing at 2 s (`TestHelperIntegrationStuckExit`, Wine).
  A fatal error the helper does not follow by exiting gets it killed after 500 ms
  (`TestHelperFatalKillsStuckHelper`).
- Frozen helper (review fix): with the real helper under Wine stopped by SIGSTOP (as if
  suspended), 34 back-to-back `SetRate` calls returned "control queue full" within 0.3 ms
  instead of blocking, and `Close` killed the helper after 2.06 s (manual run). Before
  the fix `Close` blocked indefinitely (reproduced with the in-process fake helper).
- Oversized requests (review fix): `SetROI` with more than 256 rects and any control
  message above 1 MiB fail locally and the helper keeps running
  (`TestHelperRejectsOversizedRequests`).

Hardware / real Windows checks:
- AMD RDNA3 (RX 7900 XT): unverified. Test: copy dist/windows/recon-encoder.exe to the
  host and run `recon-encoder.exe --print-caps`; expect `"vendor":"amd"`, a non-empty
  `adapterLuid`/`adapterName` for the Radeon, `"backend":"none"` (no encoder yet), and
  `unavailable.amf` = `AMF runtime 1.4.x/1.5.x found; the AMF encoder backend is not
  implemented yet (step 3.3)` (proves `amfrt64.dll` loads from System32 with
  LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32 and `AMFQueryVersion` works); `unavailable.nvenc` must say
  the DLL is not found.
- NVIDIA: unverified (no NVIDIA host available). Test: same `--print-caps` on an RTX
  host; expect `"vendor":"nvidia"`, and `unavailable.nvenc` = `NVENC API 13.x found ...`
  with a driver >= 570, or `the driver supports NVENC API 12.x, the helper is built for
  13.0 (update the driver)` with an older one.
- AMD RDNA3 (RX 7900 XT): unverified. Test: on the Windows host run the integration
  tests natively: `$env:RECON_HELPER_EXE="<dir>\recon-encoder.exe"; go test -count=1 -v
  ./internal/host/encoder`; all pass, and the log line `restart to first frame: ...`
  is below 300 ms (GUIDE 3.1 lifecycle target; Wine adds process start-up overhead).
  Also run it while a GPU-bound game runs, to see the mock's frame pacing (60 fps
  synthetic capture on a high-resolution waitable timer) holds.
- NVIDIA: unverified (no NVIDIA host available). Test: the same integration test run on
  an NVIDIA host; all pass, `restart to first frame` < 300 ms.
- AMD RDNA3 (RX 7900 XT): unverified. Test: with recon-host running a session on the
  helper (after the session integration step), kill recon-host from Task Manager;
  recon-encoder.exe must exit by itself within a second (stdin EOF), and Process
  Explorer must show no named section or event created by either process (the ring and
  event are unnamed and only inherited by the helper). Then start a new session, suspend
  recon-encoder.exe in Process Explorer and end the session: recon-host must not hang and
  must kill the helper about 2 s later.
- NVIDIA: unverified (no NVIDIA host available). Test: the same as for AMD: kill
  recon-host from Task Manager during a session; recon-encoder.exe exits by itself within
  a second and Process Explorer shows no named section or event of either process; a
  suspended recon-encoder.exe is killed about 2 s after the session ends.
